tangle plots (of read-mapping positions to circular assemblies)

Tangle plots are a way of visualising where paired reads map to a cicular reference. This reference may represent a circular genome or a tandem repetitive DNA sequence.  
Tangle plots were use by Becher & Nichols (submitted) to visualise paired reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome in the grasshopper *Podisma pedestris*. Many read pairs mapped further apart then expected given their insert size, indicating the presence of rearranged nuclear copies of the mitochondrial DNA (Numts).
